# Development Environment
* Visual Studio 2019
* .netcore 3.1
# Notes
* I have spent a couple of hours on this, sorry didn't have the luxury of time
* To get the dynamodb intergration working, add your AWS IAM user credentials in Startup.cs
* Using F5 from Visual Studio should start the working API for you
* Have not used Terraform before but happy to pick it up, with the luxury of time, would have been able to implement it
* In a real commercial application I'd add Unit tests and logging, again very poor on time hence did not get around to it
